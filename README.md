# Kanban-Blazor-Server-.NET-5.0
This is a small portion of the bigger MES (Manufacturing Execution System) software.

The Digital Kanban system is used to order the transport of goods to/from production. The purpose of that system is pretty straightforward - production has to keep on working without any micro stops. Digital Kanban making that goal real.

Technology stack in full solution:
.NET Blazor Server - browser application;
WinForms  - backend calculation and conectivity with sensors;
C#  - is there something better? :) ;
C++ - sensors to transfer data from machines (wifi);
html  - information should be visible ...;
Bootstrap   - and they should also look nice;
JavaScript + JSON  - for very nice looking AMCharts;
Syncfusion  - well, it looks like it is temporary.
